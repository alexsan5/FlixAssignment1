### Notes
I had a couple of issues getting the photo to load, as the URL link I was using was incorrect. I also could not figure out why the synopsis for Breathless would not load. Lastly, I am not sure why, but the placement of the logo when the app first opens seems to always be off no matter how I try to center it. I also could not center the film posters in the cell if the synopsis was too long.
