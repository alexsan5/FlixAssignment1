### Notes
I had a couple of issues getting the photo to load, as the URL link I was using was incorrect. I also could not figure out why the synopsis for Breathless would not load. In addition to this, I could not run the app on my phone due to a compiling error that said:
"Signing for "Flix" requires a development team. Select a development team in the Signing & Capabilities editor."
Apart from this, the app ran smoothly.
